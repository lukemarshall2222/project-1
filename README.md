Description: The goal of this project is to introduce students in CS 322 to a python web server by tasking us with adding functionality to it. The functionality that must be added is file checking. Given a URL, the server needs to be able to check for the filename in the URL and produce it on the web page if it exists in the server directory, along with a 200 OK in the header. If the file does not exist it must produce error 404 in the header as well as a description in the body of the problem. If the URL contains illegal characters '~' or '..', the server must produce an error 403 in the header as well as a description in the body of the problem.
